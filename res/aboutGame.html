        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="Description">
            Hidden Angels is a horror, escape room game. You, the player, woke up in a strange and mysterious house with no recollection of how you got there. You aim to leave this house but soon find there are gruesome and deadly creatures roaming the building. 
            To make things worse, it appears that many rooms are either locked or closed off. You know instantly that you cannot remain unnoticed for long so immediately begin searching for items to help you make your way out the house. You find a flashlight and begin to explore…
            <br><br>
            As predicted though, you are soon noticed by the creatures, you quickly turn to face the monster and while waiting for it to attack, you find out that isn’t moving. You soon realize that the creatures will not move if the flashlight is on them.
            <br><br>
            Now armed with a way to defend yourself, you now search the house with some more confidence and security.

        <h2>Monsters</h2>
        <div>
            <p class="Description">
                The monsters will also be scattered around the house. There 3 types of monsters, each will behave differently and do different amounts of damage. Some will be patrolling while others will actively track down the player, regardless they will attack the moment they see the player. 
                The monsters will however stop if the player is looking directly at them.
                <br><br>
                NOTE: Inspiration for this idea came from the Call of Duty franchise, specifically Call of Duty Black Ops 3 where if players were able to knock off the arms of mannequins of a certain map in under 2 minutes, the mannequins would come to life and follow the players around while they weren’t looking. 
                This was deemed the ‘Weeping Angels Mode’, so our game’s name pays homage to this mode.

            <h3>Basic Monster</h3>

                    <img src="./images/BasicMonster.gif" class="BasicMonster">

                <div class="controlsText">
                    <p class="Monsters">
                        The basic monster is the simplest monster the player will encounter. It will always attack the player
                        only when the player is noticed. It does one heart worth of damage and will stop when the player looks
                        directly at them. They will appear in the early stages of the game and aim to ease the player into the 
                        game mechanics.

                <div style="width:75%">
                    <p class="Monsters">
                        The large monster is slightly more complex than the basic monster. Sometimes it will attack
                        the player when the player is noticed and other times it will track the player relentlessly.
                        The large monster also hits harder, doing 1.5 hearts of damage to the player. These monsters will
                        appear in both early and late stages of the game and aims to provide the player with more of
                        a challenge.

                        The small monster is a unique type of monster that only appears in the 3rd level.
                        They will spawn from their nests in groups and will always track the player. They do 0.5
                        hearts of damage, however the challenge lies in their numbers as it easy to get overrun if
                        the player is not careful.

        <h2>Level Design</h2>
        <p class="Description">
            There are 4 Levels to the game: <br>
            Level 1: Second Floor <br>
            Level 2: First Floor <br>
            Level 3: Basement <br>
            Level 4: Hedge Maze
            <br><br>
            The Player will spawn in at the beginning of each level and they must investigate the area
            to find several key items to help them progress. It is important to remember that there are monsters
            patrolling each level, with their difficulty increasing as the player progresses through the game. If
            the player manages to solve the puzzle, they can move on to the next level, leaving the last one 
            inaccessible. Once the player reaches the end goal of the final level, they win the game.   
            <br><br>
            Aside from the natural progression, there is also an option to select what level you wish to play
            by going to the menu and clicking on the desired level.
