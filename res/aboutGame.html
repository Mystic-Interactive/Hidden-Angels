            Hidden Angels is an Escape-Room type game with a Horror twist. Your goal as the player is escape
            a house while avoiding several terrifying creatures that will attack the moment they notice you.
            Do not fret though, as these monsters have a unique fear of bright lights. They will freeze in place
            whenever the player is looking directly at them, making convenient opportunities for a quick get away.

        <h2>Level Design</h2>
        <p class="Description">
            There are 4 Levels to the game: <br>
            Level 1: Second Floor <br>
            Level 2: First Floor <br>
            Level 3: Basement <br>
            Level 4: Hedge Maze
            <br><br>
            The Player will spawn in at the beginning of each level and they must investigate the area
            to find several key items to help them progress. It is important to remember that there are monsters
            patrolling each level, with their difficulty increasing as the player progresses through the game. If
            the player manages to solve the puzzle, they can move on to the next level, leaving the last one 
            inaccessible. Once the player reaches the end goal of the final level, they win the game.   
            <br><br>
            Aside from the natural progression, there is also an option to select what level you wish to play
            by going to the menu and clicking on the desired level.
